# Predictive Modeling Pipeline for Disease Risk Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive R script designed for predictive modeling in disease risk assessment. It integrates various data sources, including metabolomics, PRS (Polygenic Risk Scores), and phenotype data, to fit predictive models for different diseases. The script offers flexibility in model selection and the inclusion of specific population groups in the training process.

## Features
- **Flexible Model Selection**: Choose from models like `glinternet`, `l1_log_reg`, or `pretrained_lasso`.
- **Population Specific Training**: Option to include only White British in training data.
- **Comprehensive Data Integration**: Combines metabolomics, PRS, and phenotype data for a holistic approach.

## Getting Started
To use this pipeline, clone the repository and ensure you have the required R packages installed.
